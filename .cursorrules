# Project Rules for Cursor AI

## Core Instructions
- Always write full code (no placeholders)
- Break down tasks into small, testable steps
- Explain before implementing
- Never replace code with comments like "// rest of code here"

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript with React functional components
- Add type definitions to all functions
- Write descriptive variable names (use full words, not abbreviations)
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

## Framework and Libraries
- React 18 with functional components
- Use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- No class components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Express.js for backend API

## File Organization
- Each component in its own folder
- Keep components under 300 lines
- Reusable logic → /utils folder
- Types → /types folder
- Services → /services folder

## Testing
- Write tests for all business logic
- Use Jest for unit tests
- Test both success and error cases
- Validate and handle errors gracefully

## Error Handling
- Always add try-catch blocks for async operations
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Log errors to the console for debugging
- Never skip error handling

## API & Backend
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all inputs
- Return proper HTTP status codes
- Include error messages in API responses

## What NOT to Do
- Don't use deprecated packages or methods
- Don't skip error handling
- Don't create files outside the project structure
- Don't change working code unless asked
- Don't hardcode API keys or secrets

## Design Preferences
- Use dark and white color scheme
- Avoid using yellow
- Keep UI clean and modern
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
